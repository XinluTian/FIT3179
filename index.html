                    <p>
                        In the <strong><span class="orange_text">1990s</span></strong>, the main tourist sources were the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. By the <span class="orange_text"><strong>2000s</strong></span>, China became a significant contributor to Australia’s tourism, driven by its growing economy and middle class. The <span class="orange_text"><strong>2008 Global Financial Crisis</strong></span> caused a temporary dip, particularly in Western markets, but the Asia-Pacific region remained strong.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Tourism peaked in the <span class="orange_text"><strong>late 2010s</strong></span>, with record numbers from China and Southeast Asia. However, the <span class="orange_text"><strong>COVID-19 pandemic in 2020</strong></span> led to a near-total halt in international travel, as reflected by lighter shades. The industry started recovering in <span class="orange_text"><strong>2022</strong></span>, though numbers remain below pre-pandemic levels.

                        From <span class="orange_text"><strong>1991 to 2019</strong></span>, international tourism to Australia experienced <span class="orange_text"><strong>steady growth</strong></span>, peaking at over 20 million visitors.

                    <h2>Tourism's Contribution to Australia's Economy by State</h2>
                    <p>
                        In 2022-23, tourism played a crucial role in several Australian states, especially in regions like Queensland and Tasmania, where it made up a significant portion of the economy. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This chart shows how tourism, represented in pink and green, contributed both directly and indirectly to each state’s economic activities. In comparison, states like Western Australia and the Northern Territory relied more heavily on industries such as mining and construction, with a smaller portion attributed to tourism.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The chart clearly illustrates how the tourism industry interacts with other key sectors, shaping Australia's economic landscape across regions.

                        Between 2007 and 2023, tourism consumption in Australian states experienced significant shifts. By using the interactive slider, you can select specific time periods to view how tourism spending has changed year by year, or focus on average consumption over a selected period. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For example, selecting 2010-2015 shows the average tourism consumption steadily increasing across most states, with New South Wales and Queensland consistently leading in total spending. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 marks a sharp decline, but the chart allows you to easily compare recovery trends across states.                     </p>
